# Random
My random scripts and applications.

## Backup
My Bash scripts to automate data backups for my homelab of servers and personal computers.

## Internet Speedtest Tracker
Bash code to automatically conduct internet speed tests on my home network on regular intervals of time to observe network speed and stability.

## SpotifyDown
Web application to automate song downloads from Spotify for self-hosting music. This is to help with the limitations of Lidarr (ie. cannot monitor singles).
